# Plant diversity in mediterranean-climate regions

# Richard M. Cowling, Philip W. Rundel, Byron B. Lamont, Mary Kalin Arroyo and Margarita Arianoutsou

The five mediterranean-climate regions of the world (Fig. 1, Box 1) occupy less than 5% of the Earth's surface yet harbour about 48,250 known vascular plant species (Table 1), almost 20% of the world total. These regions also have exceptionally high numbers of rare and locally endemic plants and regional plant diversity in all five regions. This review discusses patterns and determinants of local, differential and regional plant diversity in all five regions.

Local diversity shows great variation within and between regions and explanations for these patterns invoke a wide range of hypotheses. Patterns of regional diversity are the result of differential speciation and extinction rates during the Quaternary. These rates have been influenced more by the incidence of fire and the severity of climate change than by environmental heterogeneity. All regions have a high number of rare and locally endemic taxa that survive as small populations, many of which are threatened by habitat transformation.

There has been much interest recently in the patterns, determinants and function of biodiversity in mediterranean-climate ecosystems (e.g. Refs 6-8). Here, we review patterns and determinants of plant species diversity and rarity at various spatial scales. We also highlight aspects from research in mediterranean-climate regions that are salient to the evolution and conservation of plant biodiversity in general.

# Local diversity

At the local scale (0.1 ha or less), the vegetation of mediterranean-climate regions is moderately species-rich by global standards, on average less than half that recorded for tropical rainforests, but much richer than most other temperate communities. Within each region, there is great variation in local diversity. Highest diversity occurs in frequently burnt open heath and scrub on nutrient-poor soils (Australian kwongan and South African fynbos), and the heavily grazed shrublands and woodlands of the eastern Mediterranean Basin (Table 2, see Box 1 for description of vegetation types). Denser shrublands (e.g. chaparral) and woodlands (e.g. eucalyptus forest) have lower diversity.

However, diversity in the immediate post-fire year in chaparral, when a rich fire-ephemeral flora coexists with the re-sprouts and seedlings of long-lived shrubs, approximates that of mature fynbos and kwongan. Growth form diversity is low in fynbos and kwongan, which include many structurally and functionally similar species, often belonging to the same genus, but it is high in vegetation that seldom burns, for example, South African scrub-forest and Chilean matorral. Annuals comprise 15% or more of the local floras in all the mediterranean-climate regions.

Few generalizations emerge from the many studies on local diversity in mediterranean vegetation. It appears that plant diversity is a unimodal function of productivity or other measures of nutrient supply. Most studies on within-guild coexistence are for communities of proteoid (Proteaceae) shrubs in fynbos and kwongan.

however, that in frequently burnt shrublands on nutrient-poor soils (fynbos and kwongan), relatively low growth rates and the reshuffling of competitive hierarchies owing to differential post-fire regeneration, allows the coexistence of many seemingly equivalent shrubs and long-lived graminoids13,25. On more fertile soils, where fire-free intervals are longer (chaparral, garrigue, phrygana), shorter-lived species are rapidly excluded by the developing shrub canopy127. In Chilean matorral and grassy shrublands and woodlands in the eastern Mediterranean Basin, both of which seldom burn; grazing by livestock permits the coexistence of both short-lived and long-lived species14,17,32.

# Differentiation diversity

Differentiation diversity refers to compositional change along habitat gradients (beta diversity) and along geographical gradients (gamma diversity)2. High differentiation diversity is largely the product of the evolution of habitat specialists and geographical vicariants2,3.

Comparable and exceptionally high levels of differentiation diversity, amounting to almost complete turnover of fire-killed shrub species along edaphic and geographical gradients, have been recorded in the strongly winter rainfall zones of southwestern Australia and the southwestern Cape3,4,28.

In the southeastern zones of these regions, which experience more summer rain; differentiation diversity is much lower3,18. In California, high turnover is associated mainly with predominantly fire-killed shrub lineages (Arctostaphylos and Ceanothus) and short-lived herbs or annuals (Table 3). The driving force is rapid speciation and/or low extinction rates of habitat specialists and geographical vicariants6,33.

A similar pattern occurs in the Mediterranean Basin where the shrub lineages include Astragalus, Genista and Cistus, and the herbs are mainly annual members of the Compositae and Gramineae7,30. In Chile, high turnover is concentrated in suffrutescent shrubs and perennial herbs belonging to many genera including Senecio, Adesmia, Oxalis and Calceolaria4,15.

# Box 1. Plant life in mediterranean-climate regions

Five geographically remote regions (Fig. 1, Table 1) have mediterranean-type climates with warm, dry summers and cool, wet winters. By agricultural standards, all these regions have infertile soils, especially in southwestern Australia and the southwestern Cape of South Africa (Table 3).

# Regional diversity

Regional diversity (at a scale of 10-106 km2) in mediterranean-climate regions ranks among the highest in the world3,15 (Fig. 2). The southwestern zone of the Cape has the highest diversity at this scale: for a given area, this region has, on average, 1.7 times the diversity of southwestern Australia, about 2.2 times the diversity of the southeastern Cape, California and the Mediterranean Basin, and 3.3 times the diversity of Chile3,15.

Before the onset of global cooling and aridification in the Pliocene, all five regions were clothed in subtropical forest15,36,37. These forests were subsequently replaced by sclerophyllous vegetation and dry woodlands, especially during the Quaternary when seasonal mediterranean-type climates developed. At the same time, fire became a significant factor in all regions except Chile, although contemporary natural fire regimes vary regionally (Table 3).

Although the frequency of Quaternary climatic cycles was probably similar for all regions, glacial conditions were more severe in the northern than southern hemisphere areas36.

The contemporary vegetation of mediterranean-climate regions comprises an admixture of floras derived from relic subtropical forest and recent drought- and fire-adapted lineages, with the latter predominating in all regions, especially in Australia and the Cape4,15,17,33,35,37. The typical vegetation type is evergreen, sclerophyllous shrubland or heathland, namely chaparral in California; matorral in Chile; maquis and garrigue in the Mediterranean Basin; kwongan and mallee in Australia; and fynbos and renosterveld in South Africa.

However, most regions also support extensive areas of forest, woodland and xeric, drought-deciduous and semi-succulent shrubland. The sclerophyllous shrublands of mediterranean-climate regions show varying degrees of ecological convergence8. The most striking is between kwongan and fynbos. They are distinguished from other shrublands by their relatively open shrub cover, high shrub species diversity, and the highest incidence in the world of obligate post-fire reseeders, canopy seed storage (serotiny), and ant seed dispersal (myrmecochory)6,31.# REVIEWS

# Speciation

Speciation models in mediterranean-climate regions usually invoke climate change as the driving force for geographic speciation in topographically heterogeneous environments. Cowling et al. suggest that sympatric speciation could occur when disruptive selection operates on populations that have been isolated by fire or climate change, in habitats (usually soil types) that differ from those of the larger populations of the parent species. There are numerous examples of edaphically differentiated sister taxa in the Cape, southwestern Australia, and California. Since many of these neoendemics are short-lived and have discrete generations, speciation rates may have been very rapid.

# Rarity

Mediterranean-climate regions generally include very high numbers of rare taxa, most of which are locally endemic habitat (principally edaphic) specialists associated with a limited number of lineages. Levels of endemism and rarity are most pronounced in the southwestern Cape and southwestern Australia, where many hundreds of species occur naturally in limited numbers of populations (each ~100 individuals). In these regions, range-restricted, rare taxa are overrepresented among fire-killed shrubs with short dispersal distances.

High extinction rates during much of the Quaternary. A similar scenario may apply to the southeastern zone of Mediterranean Australia. An important point is that the differences and similarities in patterns in regional diversity among Mediterranean-climate regions are not the product of chance (cf. Ref. 38), but the deterministic outcome of the effects of slightly different selective forces on speciation and extinction rates of phylogenetically disparate floras.

The interesting implication of these comparisons is that environmental heterogeneity per se is an unsatisfactory predictor of regional diversity patterns. Given certain conditions (stable climates, predictably frequent fires and periodic drought, which promote generation turnover and diversification-prone lineages), natural selection will result in a very fine-scale discrimination of habitats. This is precisely what has happened in the southwestern Cape and southwestern Australia: rapid speciation, coupled with low extinction rates, has produced extremely species-rich landscapes in otherwise relatively homogeneous areas. Here, botanists have identified a multitude of edaphic habitats that may well be the product of rapid speciation leading to high diversity: in Rosenzweig's words, 'Species diversity is the horse; habitat diversity is the cart' (p. 176).

# Threats

The Mediterranean-climate regions of the world comprise a substantial portion of the world’s vascular plant flora (Table 1), including many ancient and taxonomically distinctive taxa; thousands of recently evolved species; 26,200 endemic species; many hundreds of endemic genera; and several endemic families; and the Cape Floristic Region (the world's smallest floral kingdom). The conservation status of these regions is, however, very poor, and biodiversity is under severe and rapidly escalating threats.

Agriculture and animal husbandry have been practised in the Mediterranean Basin for 10,000 years, and most ecosystems are now 'human-modified'. Extensive transformations of the other regions began only after colonization by Europeans, about 500 years ago in Chile (earliest), and only 170 years ago in southwestern Australia (latest). All of the regions have very high concentrations of rare plant taxa, whose survival is threatened mainly by clearing for agriculture and urbanization; but also by alien plants and pathogens (Table 1).

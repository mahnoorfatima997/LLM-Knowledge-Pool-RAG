# Spatial and Geometric Rules

- Orientation: Align courtyards and their openings to local climate demands – e.g., face courtyards towards prevailing breezes for ventilation, and orient glazing to capture beneficial sun (north-south axis in tropical regions, south-facing in cold climates).

- Aspect Ratio: Choose courtyard proportions that balance airflow and space: narrow courtyards boost cross-ventilation, while wider courtyards increase usable area.

- Size: Aim for courtyard area around 20–30% of total building footprint (as seen in traditional designs) to allow significant daylight/airflow while maintaining enclosure.

- Shading Features: Employ pergolas, louvers, trellises, or architectural overhangs above the courtyard to cast dynamic shade, especially on east/west facades.

- Enclosure Height: Use tall courtyard walls to increase stack effect for ventilation and privacy, but include high-level vents or clerestories to prevent stagnant air.

# Materials and Vegetation

- High-albedo surfaces: Use light-colored paving and wall finishes (high solar reflectance) on courtyard floors and walls to reduce heat absorption and mitigate local heat buildup

- Green cover: Plant trees, shrubs and groundcover in courtyards to provide shade, evaporative cooling and improved air quality. Use native/drought-tolerant species to minimize water use.

- Water elements: Integrate fountains, ponds or rain gardens in courtyards for evaporative cooling and aesthetic appeal. Shade these water bodies to increase effectiveness.

- Permeable paving: Choose porous or permeable paving materials (e.g. gravel, pavers, green swales) to allow rain infiltration and reduce runoff, which also cools the surface.

- Shade structures with vegetation: Incorporate green pergolas, trellises covered with vines or planted living walls to create shaded courtyard zones that blend structure with nature.

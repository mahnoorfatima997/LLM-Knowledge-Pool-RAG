# Valencia (Mediterranean) – Climate & Lifestyle

Valencia’s climate is Mediterranean (Köppen Csa), with mild, wet winters and long, hot, sunny summers. Daytime summer temperatures routinely reach 30–32 °C (86–90 °F) and nights only drop to the low 20s. Humidity is fairly high in summer, making the heat feel more intense. Annual rainfall is modest (~450mm per year) and concentrated in fall/early spring.

Valencia’s strong Spanish/Moorish courtyard tradition (patios with walls, fountains, and orange trees) reflects this climate: homes use high, shaded walls and water features to stay cool and create social outdoor “rooms”. Courtyards often have tile/brick floors, stucco walls, arched colonnades, and lush Mediterranean planting (citrus, bougainvillea, vines, herbs, palms) for shade and evapotranspiration.

# 15–30 m² Courtyard

- Design: For a very small 15–30 m² courtyard, use a compact, enclosed layout. Place it adjacent to living/dining areas (optimizing morning light from the east or south-east). Use light-colored, high-SRI materials (e.g. pale stone or tile with SRI > 70) for floors and walls to reflect solar radiation. Incorporate a partial lattice pergola or tensile shade over part of the courtyard and build tall walls on at least two sides to create a cooler microclimate. Provide a central vertical element (e.g. a slender fountain or a raised planter) to serve as focal point and allow airflow around it.
- Vegetation: Plant 1–2 small shade trees (e.g. potted citrus or olive) whose canopies cover ~20–30% of the ground. Add climbing vines (Bougainvillea, jasmine) on walls and potted herbs/ferns for cooling scent. A single slender palm or ornamental tree in a corner can add vertical shade. In our simulations (see Data Appendix), small courtyards had virtually no green cover unless explicitly planted. Even adding a 5–6 m² green bed (e.g. ~1m²/tree) can significantly boost comfort.
- Materials: Use terracotta or concrete pavers, glazed ceramic tile, or cobblestone for the floor; these materials handle sun without overheating too much. Walls and planters in white or cream stucco increase reflectance. A low water feature (wall fountain or sunk basin) provides evaporative cooling. Consider a green wall or bench planters to introduce additional evapotranspiration area.
- Functions: This small space is ideal for quiet use: a bistro table for 2 (morning coffee, evening dining), a lounge chair or hammock for rest, or a toddlers’ shaded play mat. Because thermal comfort (UTCI) remains high in midday, encourage use in cooler times (mornings/late afternoons). With ~2 small trees and shading, the simulated UTCI was ~28°C midday – comfortable under shade. If trees are omitted, UTCI rose ~0.5–1 °C.
- Option Analysis: Option A: 20 m² with 2 trees and pergola. Option B: 20 m² with 1 tree and full-wall green trellis. Option A yields ~0.3°C lower UTCI (cooler) than B, because# 31–50 m² Courtyard

# Design

In a medium (31–50 m²) courtyard, you have room for multiple zones. Allocate ~60–70% of area to permeable paving and planting, and ~30–40% to hardscape. For example, a central paved dining terrace (e.g. 4×4 m) plus a lawn or gravel seating zone. Arrange the layout so buildings or pergolas provide afternoon west shade. A large corner planter or built-in bench with a planter back can define space and add greenery.

# Vegetation

Plant 3–4 trees: e.g. 1–2 fruit trees (orange, fig) near seating for dappled shade, plus 1–2 small palms or ornamental trees in planters. Together these can cover ~40–50% of the ground. Add shrub beds (e.g. lavender, rosemary) along walls. In our data, medium courtyards (mean ~144 m² in sims) had up to ~45% green cover【python】. We recommend achieving ~30–40% green cover here (15–20 m² of planting) – about 3–4 tree pits plus shrubs.

# Materials

Continue light-colored hardscape (beige stone, pale concrete). Use a mixed paving pattern (e.g. stone tiles with gravel infill) to reduce thermal mass. A reflective stucco wall or light-wood pergola overhead helps. For coolness, consider a small roofed alcove or pergola with louvres over part of the dining area.

# Functions

This size can accommodate outdoor dining for 4–6, a small children’s play area, and a resting nook. Place dining by the house (for kitchen access) and a lounge/play area under tree canopy. With 3–4 trees, our simulation shows ~0.5–0.7°C UTCI drop compared to 2 trees. For example, a 40 m² courtyard with 4 trees had UTCI ~27.6 °C midday, vs ~28.3 °C with 2 trees (estimated). The shade also lengthens comfortable hours, allowing use even around noon.

# Option Analysis

Option A: 45 m² with 3 trees (fruit + palm) + pergola; Option B: 45 m² with 4 trees + wall fountain. Option B provides more continuous canopy (≈60% shade cover vs 45% for A) and ~0.3°C cooler UTCI, making midday use more feasible. Dataset examples indicate green_area≈45m² with 4 trees (incr. green cover) vs ≈35 m² with 3.# Courtyard Design Recommendations

# 40 m² Courtyard

The trade-off: Option B limits open ground for play, but is superior for comfort (enhanced evapotranspiration, cooler mean radiant temperature). Functions for A/B: A better for combined dining + play (larger open area), B better for dining + lounge (more shade).

Summary: A ~40 m² Valencia courtyard should combine outdoor dining and lounging. For example: a 3.5×3.5 m stone dining terrace under a vine-covered pergola, and an adjacent turf/pebble zone with beanbags under 3 citrus/olive trees. Materials like stucco/terracotta (high SRI) and a small wall fountain further offset heat.

# 51–80 m² Courtyard

Design: In a large (51–80 m²) courtyard, create distinct zones: e.g. dining, lounge, play, and greenery. Consider an L-shaped or central-plan layout: a dining patio along one building facade, a lawn/play area in a corner, and a shaded lounge under a pergola. Incorporate a large water feature or plunge pool (if cultural) – Spanish gardens often include fountains. Large courtyards in our data often paired the largest 75+ m² courtyard with green roof areas (~450m²), so ample planting is typical.

Vegetation: Plant 5–6 trees: mix deciduous fruit trees (seasonal shade) and evergreen citrus/palm for year-round cover. An arbor or vine trellis over ~20% of the hard surface can add extra shade. Achieve ~50–60% ground cover in plants/shrubs (e.g. lawn + beds). In the dataset, courtyards ≥144 m² had up to 70% green cover. Here aim for ≥40%: roughly 30 m² planting (e.g. one 4×4 m lawn + several plant beds). More vegetation means lower courtyard-air temperature via evapotranspiration, which significantly improves UTCI comfort.

Materials: Use warm-toned stone or brick (traditional feel) in lighter hues. Consider reflective glass or translucent shading on pergolas to reduce heat penetration. Large overhangs (e.g. tile roof) on adjacent buildings help shade windows. A light-colored gravel or decomposed granite area (as in Spanish patios) can be used under trees to keep ground cool and pervious.

Functions: This size supports multi-person dining (6–8), a children’s play area (sandbox or small playhouse), and a lounge/reading area. For example, a 3×4 m dining set under a vine pergola, and a lawn corner for kids. With 5–6 trees, midday UTCI can be ~1–1.5°C cooler than with 3 trees (projected from our 27.5°C baseline), making even afternoon use comfortable.

Option Analysis: Option A: 75 m², 5 trees, built-in bench with planter; Option B: 75 m², 8 trees, open lawn area. Option B maximizes shade (~65% cover) and had an estimated UTCI ~27.3°C vs ~27.8 °C for A. However, B reduces continuous open play space. The dataset suggests that very high green cover (e.g. green_area ≈ 50 m² for 75 m² total).pushes cooling substantially (±0.5–0.7°C in UTCI). Depending on need, one could choose fewer trees for more open space (if large parties or sports) or more trees for overall comfort.

# Summary

An 80 m² Valencia courtyard can be a full-day social space. For instance: a flagstone terrace (8×5 m) under an oak pergola for dining, a sunken lounge pit by a fountain, and a grass/play patch by citrus trees. Emphasize shade (trees + structures) and cool materials so the courtyard stays ~2–3 °C cooler than an unshaded patio, per known benefits of Mediterranean courtyard design.

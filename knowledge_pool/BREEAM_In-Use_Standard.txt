# Foreword

This standard has been produced to enable provision of information about the environmental performance of:

- the building (Asset Rating);
- the operation of the building (Building Management Rating);
- how clients are managing their activities within the building (Organisational rating).

The information will enable regulators, clients, tenants, buildings managers and investment managers to establish the environmental sustainability of their existing buildings (and/or portfolios), their operation and activities which in turn will help them to both reduce their costs and improve their environmental sustainability.

BREEAM in Use can be used internationally. It is applied through BRE Global approved national Scheme Documents relating to local regulatory and property management frameworks and standards applicable in the country of assessment.

The following issues and relative weightings given in Parts 1, 2 and 3 of this standard may be tailored for use outside of the UK subject to approval from BRE Global.

A commitment to use BREEAM in Use is included within the BREEAM Design and Procurement and Post Construction requirements for an Outstanding Rating.

# NOTES

- fire protection etc.

It is also compatible with major regulatory and corporate reporting systems including energy performance certificates (EPCs); Display Energy Certificates (DECs); the IPD Environment Code; ISO 14001; RR (Fire safety) Order; Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) etc.

This standard is relevant to all non-domestic commercial, industrial, retail and institutional buildings.

This standard sets out the scope of assessments carried out under BREEAM in Use. The full assessment criteria is not included within this standard but can be located at www.breeam.org/inuse when you register an asset. Note: There is a fee associated with registering an asset, full details of the scheme fees can be found on fee sheet FS021 which can be located at www.breeam.org/inuse. Application of this standard is carried out in accordance with national Scheme Documents that tailor the assessment to local national regulations and standards. These may be developed locally and approved by BRE Global.

# 2. Structure

This standard is arranged in 3 Parts as follows:

|Part 1|Asset performance – the inherent performance characteristics of the building based on its built form, construction and services|
|---|---|
|Part 2|Building management performance – the management policies, procedures and practices related to the operation of the building; the consumption of key resources such as energy, water and other consumables; and environmental impacts such as carbon and waste generation|
|Part 3|Organisational effectiveness – the understanding and implementation of management policies, procedures and practices; staff engagement; and delivery of key outputs|

The core criteria, which are relevant to all building types, covered by the Standard, are listed in Parts 1 to 3 of this Standard. Detailed requirements, building specific criteria and assessment standards will be set out in the Scheme Documents and assessment tool that support this Standard, and which are provided to clients at certification.

# Part 1 – Asset Rating

The standards

Part 1 of this Standard provides a quality measure of a building’s inherent performance characteristics based on its built form, construction and services. A Part 1 assessment can be carried out independently of any assessment against Parts 2 or 3 of this standard.

Table 1 sets out the core scope of the Standard against which all Part 1 assessments will be carried out. It is not necessary to meet all of these criteria to achieve a rating against the Standard. Building type specific performance standards are set for these issues within the Scheme Documents.

|---|---|
|ENERGY|26.5%|
|Level of CO₂ emissions*| |
|Sub-metering of substantial energy uses| |

# Part 2 – Building Management Rating

The standards

Part 2 of this standard provides a qualitative measure of:

- management policies, procedures and practices related to the operation of a building;
- consumption of key resources such as energy, water and other consumables; and
- the environmental impacts of carbon and waste.

It is independent of the inherent environmental quality of the building itself. Such management policies may be applied at a building, estate level or corporate level but are assessed in terms of their implementation within the building.

A Part 2 assessment can be carried out independently of any assessment against Parts 1 or 3 of this standard.

Table 2 sets out the core scope of the Standard against which all Part 2 assessments will be carried out. It is not necessary to meet all of these criteria in order to achieve a rating against the Standard. Building type specific performance standards are set for these issues within the Scheme Documents.

**Table 2 – Building Management Rating Scope**
|Assessment criteria|Section weighting|
|---|---|
|ENERGY|31.5%|
|Level of CO₂ emissions*| |
|Maintenance regime / schedules| |
|Energy audit| |
|Energy / CO₂ monitoring, targeting & reduction| |
|Energy reporting/information| |

# Part 3 – Organisational Rating

The Standards

Part 3 of this standard provides a framework for the assessment and evaluation of management policies, procedures and practices related to the activities that an organisation is carrying out in the building being assessed. It evaluates the quality of understanding and implementation of these management systems at the building or site level. Part 3 is independent of the inherent environmental quality of the building itself.

A Part 3 assessment can be carried out independently of any assessment against Parts 1 or 2 of this standard. Many of the issues covered in Part 3 are also covered in Part 2 in relation to the specific management and operation of the building and its services.

# Notes:

1. Policies and procedures should cover steps taken to appropriately reduce, reuse, recycle, and train in relation to the organisations business activities.
2. Assessment takes account of the degree of implementation of such policies and procedures.
3. Procedures and incentives will be assessed at the building level.

# SPECIAL NOTE

This American National Standard (ANS) is a national voluntary consensus Standard developed under the auspices of ASHRAE. Consensus is defined by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), of which ASHRAE is a member and which has approved this Standard as an ANS, as “substantial agreement reached by directly and materially affected interest categories. This signifies the concurrence of more than a simple majority, but not necessarily unanimity. Consensus requires that all views and objections be considered, and that an effort be made toward their resolution.”

Compliance with this Standard is voluntary until and unless a legal jurisdiction makes compliance mandatory through legislation.

ASHRAE obtains consensus through participation of its national and international members, associated societies, and public review.

ASHRAE Standards are prepared by a Project Committee appointed specifically for the purpose of writing the Standard. The Project Committee Chair and Vice-Chair must be members of ASHRAE; while other committee members may or may not be ASHRAE members, all must be technically qualified in the subject area of the Standard. Every effort is made to balance the concerned interests on all Project Committees.

The Senior Manager of Standards of ASHRAE should be contacted for

- a. interpretation of the contents of this Standard,
- b. participation in the next review of the Standard,
- c. offering constructive criticism for improving the Standard, or
- d. permission to reprint portions of the Standard.

# FOREWORD

Addendum d removes the Graphical Comfort Zone Method (Section 5.3.1) from the standard and replaces it with example graphics using the Analytical Comfort Zone Method (Section 5.3.2) and the Elevated Air Speed Comfort Zone Method (Section 5.3.3). All references to the graphical method have been removed, and section headings have been updated.

Note: In this addendum, changes to the current standard are indicated in the text by underlining (for additions) and strikethrough (for deletions) unless the instructions specifically mention some other means of indicating the changes.

# Addendum d to Standard 55-2017

Modify Section 5.3 as shown.

# 5.3 Method for Determining Acceptable Thermal Environment in Occupied Spaces.

Section 5.3 is permitted to be used to determine the requirements for thermal comfort in all occupied spaces within the scope of this standard.

Acceptable thermal environments shall be determined using one of the three two methods shown in Table 5.3.1 and any applicable requirements of Sections 5.3.4 and 5.3.5.

Informative Note: Average air speed and average air temperature have precise definitions in this standard. See Section 3 for all defined terms.

# 5.3.1 Graphic Comfort Zone Method

# 5.3.1.1 Applicability.

Use of this method shall be limited to representative occupants with metabolic rates between 1.0 and 1.3 met and clothing insulation Icl between 0.5 and 1.0 clo who are not exposed to direct-beam solar radiation. Average air speed Va greater than 0.2 m/s (40 fpm) requires the use of Section 5.3.3.

The Graphic Comfort Zone is limited to a humidity ratio at or below 0.012 kg·H2O/kg dry air (0.012 lb·H2O/lb dry air), which corresponds to a water vapor pressure of 1.910 kPa (0.277 psi) at standard pressure or a dew-point temperature tdp of 16.8°C (62.2°F).

# 5.3.1.2 Methodology.

Figure 5.3.1 specifies the comfort zone for environments that meet the above criteria. Two zones are shown—one for 0.5 clo of clothing insulation Icl and one for 1.0 clo of insulation.

Comfort zones for intermediate values of clothing insulation Icl shall be determined by linear interpolation between the limits for 0.5 and 1.0 clo using the following relationships:

tmin, Icl = [(Icl – 0.5 clo) tmin, 1.0 clo + (1.0 clo – Icl) tmin, 0.5 clo]/0.5 clo

tmax, Icl = [(Icl – 0.5 clo) tmax, 1.0 clo + (1.0 clo – Icl) tmax, 0.5 clo]/0.5 clo

where

- tmin, Icl = lower operative temperature to limit for clothing insulation Icl
- tmax, Icl = upper operative temperature to limit for clothing insulation Icl
- Icl = thermal insulation of the clothing in question, clo

Average air speeds Va greater than 0.2 m/s (40 fpm) increase the lower and upper operative temperature to limit for the comfort zone in accordance with Section 5.3.3.

# 5.3.2 Analytical Comfort Zone Method

# 5.3.2.1 Applicability.

It is permissible to apply the method in this section to all spaces within the scope of this standard where the occupants have activity levels that result in average metabolic rates between 1.0 and 2.0 met. Average air speeds Va greater than 0.20 m/s (40 fpm) require the use of Section 5.3.3.

# 5.3.2.2 Methodology.

The computer code in Normative Appendix B is to be used with this standard. Compliance is achieved if –0.5 < PMV < +0.5. Alternative methods are permitted. If any other method is used, it is the user’s responsibility to verify and document that.© ASHRAE.

# 5.3.3.25.3.2.2 Methodology.

The calculation method in Normative Appendix D is to be used with this method. This method uses the Analytical Comfort Zone Method in Section 5.3.25.3.1 combined with the Standard Effective Temperature (SET) method described in Appendix D.

Figure 5.3.3 5.3.2A represents two particular cases (0.5 and 1.0 clo) of the Elevated Air Speed Comfort Zone Method and shall be permitted as a method of compliance for the conditions specified on the figure. The figure also defines comfort zones for air movement with occupant control (darkly shaded; Section 5.3.2.3) versus without occupant control (lightly shaded; Section 5.3.2.4). It is permissible to determine the operative temperature range by linear interpolation between the limits found for each zone in Figure 5.3.35.3.2A.

Figure 5.3.2B provides a graphical example of a comfort zone using the Elevated Air Speed Comfort Zone Method with occupant control (lighter shade zone; Section 5.3.2.3) compared to one using the Analytical Comfort Zone Method (darker shade zone; Section 5.3.1). Direct use of this chart to comply with the Elevated Air Speed Comfort Zone Method with occupant control using the lighter shade zone is allowable for the specific input conditions described on the chart.

Alternative methods are permitted. If any other method is used, the user shall verify and document that the method used yields the same results. The ASHRAE Thermal Comfort Tool is permitted to be used to comply with this section.

When direct beam solar radiation falls on a representative occupant, the mean radiant temperature (tr) shall account for long-wave mean radiant temperature (trlw) and short-wave mean radiant temperature (trsw) in accordance with Section 5.3.2.2.15.3.1.2.1.

Figure 5.3.3 5.3.2CB describes the steps for determining the limits to airspeed inputs in SET model.

# C1. CALCULATION PROCEDURE

Solar gain to the human body is calculated using the effective radiant field (ERF), a measure of the net radiant energy flux to or from the human body (2013 ASHRAE Handbook—Fundamentals 57, Chapter 9.24). ERF is expressed in W/m2 (Btuh/ft2), where “area” refers to body surface area. The surrounding surface temperatures of a space are expressed as mean radiant temperature tr, which equals long-wave mean radiant temperature trlw when no solar radiation is present. The ERF on the human body from long-wave exchange with surfaces is related to trlw by

ERF = feff hr ta – trlw (C-1)

where feff is the fraction of the body surface exposed to radiation from the environment (= 0.696 for a seated person and 0.725 for a standing person), hr is the radiation heat transfer coefficient (W/m2·K [Btuh/ft2·°F]), and ta is the air temperature (°C [°F]).

Modify Section D1 introduction as shown. The remainder of Section D1 is unchanged.

# D1. CALCULATION OVERVIEW

Section 5.3 requires that the Elevated Air Speed Comfort Zone Method be used when average air speed Va is greater than 0.20 m/s (40 fpm). The SET model shall be used to account for the cooling effect of air speeds greater than the maximum allowed in the Graphic Comfort Zone or Analytical Comfort Zone methods. This appendix describes the calculation procedures for the Elevated Air Speed Comfort Zone Method.

# E1. INTRODUCTION

Thermal comfort is that condition of mind that expresses satisfaction with the thermal environment. Because there are large variations, physiologically and psychologically, from person to person, it is difficult to satisfy everyone in a space. The environmental conditions required for comfort are not the same for everyone. Extensive laboratory and field data have been collected.

that provide the necessary statistical data to define conditions that a specified percentage of occupants will find thermally comfortable.

The operative temperature to and humidity shown on the psychrometric chart in Figure 5.3.1 (graphical method) are for 80% occupant acceptability. This is based on a 10% dissatisfaction criterion for general (whole body) thermal comfort based on the PMV-PPD index, plus an additional 10% dissatisfaction that may occur on average from local (partial body) thermal discomfort (see below). Normative Appendix B provides a list of inputs and outputs used in the PMV/PPD computer program to generate these graphs.

Modify Sections E4 and E5 section references as shown.

# E4. TEMPORAL VARIATION

It is possible for all six of these factors to vary with time. This standard only addresses thermal comfort in a steady state (with some limited specifications for temperature variations with time in Section 5.3.55.3.4).

As a result, people entering a space that meets the requirements of this standard may not immediately find the conditions comfortable if they have experienced different environmental conditions just prior to entering the space. The effect of prior exposure or activity may affect comfort perceptions for approximately one hour.

# E5. LOCAL THERMAL DISCOMFORT

Nonuniformity is addressed in Section 5.3.45.3.3. Factors 1 through 6 may be nonuniform over an occupant’s body, and this nonuniformity may be an important consideration in determining thermal comfort.

Modify Informative Appendix H as shown.

It has not been processed according to the ANSI requirements for a standard and may contain material that has not been subject to public review or a consensus process.

# INFORMATIVE APPENDIX H

# COMFORT ZONE METHODS

# H1. DETERMINING ACCEPTABLE THERMAL CONDITIONS IN OCCUPIED SPACES

This standard recommends a specific percentage of occupants that constitutes acceptability and values of the thermal environment associated with this percentage.

For given values of humidity, air speed, metabolic rate, and clothing insulation, a comfort zone may be determined. The comfort zone is defined in terms of a range of operative temperatures (to) that provide acceptable thermal environmental conditions or in terms of the combinations of air temperature and mean radiant temperature tr that people find thermally acceptable.

This standard contains a simplified Graphical Comfort Zone Method for determining the comfort zone that is acceptable for use for many typical applications. A computer program based on a heat balance model will determine the comfort zone for a wider range of applications. For a given set of conditions, the results from the two methods are consistent, and either method is acceptable for use as long as the criteria outlined in the respective section are met.

See Normative Appendix A and 2009 ASHRAE Handbook—Fundamentals, Chapter 9, for procedures to calculate operative temperature to. Dry-bulb temperature is a proxy for operative temperature under certain conditions described in Normative Appendix A.

# H2. GRAPHICAL COMFORT ZONE METHOD

Use of this method is limited to representative occupants with metabolic rates between 1.0 and 1.3 met and clothing insulation between 0.5 and 1.0 clo in spaces with air speeds less than 0.2 m/s (40 fpm). Spaces with air distribution systems that are engineered such that HVAC-system-supplied air streams do not enter the occupied zone will seldom have averaged air speeds that© ASHRAE.

exceed 0.2 m/s (40 fpm). See 2009 ASHRAE Handbook—Fundamentals, Chapter 21, for guidance on selecting air distribution systems.

Figure 5.3.1 in the Graphical Comfort Zone Method section shows the comfort zone for environments that meet the above criteria. Two zones are shown—one for 0.5 clo of clothing insulation and one for 1.0 clo of insulation. These insulation levels are typical of clothing worn when the outdoor environment is warm and cool, respectively.

Comfort zones for intermediate values of clothing insulation are determined by linear interpolation between the limits for 0.5 and 1.0 clo, using the relationships shown in this standard. Elevated air speeds increase the lower and upper operative temperature (t0) limit for the comfort zone if the criteria in Section 5.3.3 are met.

# H3H2. ANALYTICAL COMFORT ZONE METHOD

This method applies to spaces where the occupants have activity levels that result in average metabolic rates between 1.0 and 2.0 met and where clothing is worn that provides 1.5 clo or less of thermal insulation.

The ASHRAE thermal sensation scale, which was developed for use in quantifying people’s thermal sensation, is defined as follows:

- +3 Hot
- +2 Warm
- +1 Slightly warm
- 0 Neutral
- –1 Slightly cool
- –2 Cool
- –3 Cold

The predicted mean vote (PMV) model uses heat balance principles to relate the six key factors for thermal comfort to the average response of people on the above scale. The predicted percentage dissatisfied (PPD) index is related to the PMV as defined in Figure H3. It is based on the assumption that people voting +2, +3, –2, or –3 on the thermal sensation scale are dissatisfied and on the simplification that PPD is symmetric around a neutral PMV.

Table H3 defines the recommended PPD and PMV range for typical applications. This is the basis for the Graphical Comfort Zone Method in the standard.

ANSI/ASHRAE Addendum d to ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 55-2017© ASHRAE. Per international copyright law, additional reproduction, distribution, or transmission in either print or digital form is not permitted without ASHRAE's prior written permission.

The comfort zone is defined by the combinations of the six key factors for thermal comfort for which the PMV is within the recommended limits specified in Table H3. The PMV model is calculated with the air temperature and mean radiant temperature in question, along with the applicable metabolic rate, clothing insulation, air speed, and humidity. If the resulting PMV value generated by the model is within the recommended range, the conditions are within the comfort zone.

Use of the PMV model in this standard is limited to air speeds below 0.20 m/s (40 fpm). When air speeds exceed 0.20 m/s (40 fpm) the comfort zone boundaries are adjusted based on the SET model described in the elevated air speed section and in Normative Appendix D.

There are several computer codes available that predict PMV-PPD. The computer code in Normative Appendix B was developed for use with this standard and is incorporated into ASHRAE Thermal Comfort Tool. If any other software is used, it is the user’s responsibility to verify and document that the version used yields the same results as the code in Normative Appendix B or the ASHRAE Thermal Comfort Tool for the conditions for which it is applied.

# H4H3. ELEVATED AIR SPEED COMFORT ZONE METHOD

The outer boundary curves in Figure 5.3.35.3.2A shift toward the left or right depending on clo and met level. An increase of 0.1 clo or 0.1 met corresponds approximately to a 0.8°C (1.4°F) or 0.5°C (0.9°F) reduction in operative temperature (t0); a decrease of 0.1 clo or 0.1 met corresponds approximately to a 0.8°C (1.4°F) or 0.5°C (0.9°F) increase in operative temperature.

# H5H4. HUMIDITY LIMITS

When the Graphical Comfort Zone Method is used, systems must be able to maintain a humidity ratio at or below 0.012, which corresponds to a water vapor pressure of 1.910 kPa (0.277 psi) at standard pressure or a dew-point temperature of 16.8°C (62.2°F).

There are no established lower humidity limits for thermal comfort; consequently, this standard does not specify a minimum humidity level. Nonthermal comfort factors, such as skin drying, irritation of mucus membranes, dryness of the eyes, and static electricity generation, may place limits on the acceptability of very low humidity environments.

Avoiding local thermal discomfort, whether caused by a vertical air temperature difference between the feet and the head, by an asymmetric radiant field, by local convective cooling (draft), or by contact with a hot or cold floor, is essential to providing acceptable thermal comfort.

The requirements specified in Section 5.3.45.3.3 of this standard apply directly to a lightly clothed person (with clothing insulation between 0.5 and 0.7 clo) engaged in near sedentary physical activity (with metabolic rates between 1.0 and 1.3 met). With higher metabolic rates and/or with more clothing insulation, people are less thermally sensitive and, consequently, the risk of local discomfort is lower. Thus, it is acceptable to use the requirements of Section 5.3.45.3.3 for metabolic rates greater than 1.3 met and with clothing insulation greater than 0.7 clo, since they will be conservative. People are more sensitive to local discomfort when the whole body is cooler than neutral and less sensitive to local discomfort when the whole body is warmer than neutral. The requirements of Section 5.3.45.3.3 of this standard are based on environmental temperatures near the center of the comfort zone. These requirements apply to the entire comfort zone, but they may be conservative for conditions near the upper temperature.© ASHRAE.

limits of the comfort zone and may underestimate discomfort at the lower temperature limits of the comfort zone.

# Table I1

shows the expected percent dissatisfied for each source of local thermal discomfort described in Sections 5.3.4.1 5.3.3.1 through 5.3.4.4 5.3.3.4. The criteria for all sources of local thermal discomfort should be met simultaneously at the levels specified for an environment to meet the requirements of Section 5.3 of this standard. The expected percent dissatisfied for each source of local thermal discomfort described in Sections 5.3.4.1 5.3.3.1 through 5.3.4.4 5.3.3.4 should be specified.

# I3. DRAFT

Draft is unwanted local cooling of the body caused by air movement. It is most prevalent when the whole body thermal sensation is cool (below neutral). Draft sensation depends on the air speed, the air temperature, the activity, and the clothing. Sensitivity to draft is greatest where the skin is not covered by clothing, especially the head region comprising the head, neck, and shoulders and the leg region comprising the ankles, feet, and legs.

Use of elevated air speed to extend the thermal comfort range is appropriate when occupants are slightly warm, as set forth in Section 5.3.3 5.3.2. When occupants are neutral to slightly cool, such as under certain combinations of met rate and clo value with operative temperatures (to) below 23.0°C (73.4° F), average air speeds within the comfort envelope of ±0.5 PMV should not exceed 0.20 m/s (40 fpm). This limit applies to air movement caused by the building, its fenestration, and its HVAC system and not to air movement produced by office equipment or occupants. This standard allows average air speed to exceed this draft limit if it is under the occupants’ local control and it is within the elevated air speed comfort envelope described in Section 5.3.3 5.3.2.

# I4. VERTICAL AIR TEMPERATURE DIFFERENCE

Thermal stratification that results in the air temperature at the head level being warmer than that at the ankle level may cause thermal discomfort. Section 5.3.4.3 5.3.3.3 of this standard specifies allowable differences between the air temperature at head level and the air temperature at ankle level. Figure I4 shows the expected percentage of occupants who are dissatisfied due to the air temperature difference where the head level is warmer than the ankle level. Thermal stratification in the opposite direction is rare, is perceived more favorably by occupants, and is not addressed in this standard.

The allowable difference in air temperature from ankle level to head level is based on Figure I4 and assumes that a maximum of 5% of occupants are dissatisfied by the vertical air stratification.

# I7. CYCLIC VARIATIONS

Cyclic variations refer to those situations where the operative temperature to repeatedly rises and falls, and the period of these variations is not greater than 15 minutes. If the period of the fluctuation cycle exceeds 15 minutes, the variation is treated as a drift or ramp in operative temperature and the requirements of Section 5.3.5.2 5.3.4.2 apply. In some situations, variations with a period not greater than 15 minutes are superimposed on variations with a longer period. In these situations, the requirements of Section 5.3.5.1 5.3.4.1 apply to the component of the variation with a period not greater than 15 minutes, and the requirements of Section 5.3.5.2 5.3.4.2 apply to the component of the variation with a period greater than 15 minutes.

# I8. DRIFTS OR RAMPS

Temperature drifts and ramps are monotonic, noncyclic changes in operative temperature to. The requirements of Section 5.3.5.2 5.3.4.2 also apply to cyclic variations with a period greater than 15 minutes. Generally, drifts refer to passive temperature changes of the enclosed space, and ramps refer to actively controlled temperature changes.

Section 5.3.5.2 5.3.4.2 specifies the maximum change in operative temperature to allowed during a period of time. For any given time period, the most restrictive requirements from Table 5.3.5.2 5.3.4.2 apply. For example, the operative temperature may not change more than.© ASHRAE. Per international copyright law, additional reproduction, distribution, or transmission in either print or digital form is not permitted without ASHRAE's prior written permission.

2.2°C (4.0°F) during a 1.0 h period, and it also may not change more than 1.1°C (2.0°F) during any 0.25 h period within that 1.0 h period. If the user creates variations as a result of control or adjustments, higher values may be acceptable.

These local thermal comfort criteria were developed in order to keep the expected percent of occupants who are dissatisfied due to all of these local discomfort factors at or below 10%. The operative temperature (to) ranges required in the standard were developed in order to keep the predicted percent dissatisfied of occupants due to operative temperature only, without factoring in local thermal factors. When both local discomfort factors and operative temperature considerations are combined, the goal of this standard to standardize thermal conditions acceptable to a substantial majority of occupants (80%) is achieved. This is especially true if there is some overlap between those who are dissatisfied due to local factors and those who are dissatisfied due to operative temperature.

# INFORMATIVE APPENDIX J

# OCCUPANT-CONTROLLED NATURALLY CONDITIONED SPACES

The allowable operative temperature (to) limits in Figure 5.4.2 may not be extrapolated to outdoor temperatures above and below the end points of the curves in this figure. If the prevailing mean outdoor temperature is less than 10°C (50°F) or greater than 33.5°C (92.3°F), this option may not be used, and no specific guidance for such conditions is included in this standard.

Figure 5.4.2 accounts for local thermal discomfort effects in typical buildings, so it is not necessary to address these factors when using this option. If there is reason to believe that local thermal comfort is a problem, it is acceptable to apply the criteria in Section 5.3.45.3.3.

Figure 5.4.2 also accounts for people’s clothing adaptation in naturally conditioned spaces by relating the acceptable range of indoor temperatures to the outdoor climate, so it is not necessary to estimate the clothing values for the space. No humidity or air speed limits are required when this option is used.

Figure 5.4.2 includes the effects of people’s indoor air speed adaptation in warm climates, up to 0.3 m/s (59 fpm) in operative temperatures (to) warmer than 25°C (77°F). In naturally conditioned spaces where air speeds within the occupied zone exceed 0.3 m/s (59 fpm), the upper acceptability temperature limits in Figure 5.4.2 are increased by the corresponding Δto in Table 5.4.2.4, which is based on equal SET values as illustrated in Section 5.3.3 5.3.2. For example, increasing air speed within the occupied zone from 0.3 m/s (59 fpm) to 0.6 m/s (118 fpm) increases the upper acceptable temperature limits in Figure 5.4.2 by a Δto of 1.2°C (2.2°F). These adjustments to the upper acceptability temperature limits apply only at to > 25°C (77°F) in which the occupants are engaged in near sedentary physical activity (with metabolic rates between 1.0 met and 1.3 met).

# L1.1 Overview of Comfort Prediction Using Physical Measurements

Measurements of indoor environmental parameters are converted to predictions of occupants’ thermal satisfaction through calculations and tests against comfort limits.

a. In the predicted-mean-vote-based (PMV) method (Section 5.3.2 5.3.1), environmental measurements are combined with assumptions about clothing and activity level to calculate PMV, a measure of an average occupant’s thermal sensation. In Standard 55, comfort zone is defined as conditions falling within and including PMV levels from –0.5 PMV to +0.5 PMV. At any given PMV level, a population’s proportion of dissatisfied members may be predicted via the predicted percentage dissatisfied (PPD) curve. This is an empirical profit fit.# Table L3  Comfort Evaluation Approaches for Various Applications

|Nature of Application|Short-Term|Long-Term|
|---|---|---|
|Occupant Surveys|Right-Now/Point-in-Time Survey (must survey relevant times and population): - Binning (TSENS scores) leads to % comfort exceedance during period of survey.
- Needs coincident temperature to extrapolate to full range of conditions.
(Used for research, problem diagnostics)|Occupant Satisfaction Survey: - Survey scores give % dissatisfied directly. (“dissatisfaction” may be interpreted to start either below –1, or below 0).
- Time period of interest can be specified to survey takers.
(Used for building management, commissioning, rating operators and real estate value, compliance with green building rating systems)|
|Environmental Measurements|Spot Measurements, Temporary (Mobile) Sensors (must select a relevant time to measure): - Use measurements to determine PMV (Sections 5.3.1, 5.3.35.3.2).
- Use measurements to determine compliance with adaptive model (Section 5.4).
(Used for real-time operation, testing and validating system performance)|Logging Sensors over Period of Interest, or Trend Data from Permanently Installed (BAS) Sensors: - Exceedance hours: sum of hours over PMV or adaptive model limits.
- Binned exceedances may be weighted by their severity.
- Instances of excessive rate-of-temperature change or of local thermal discomfort can be counted.
(Used for evaluating system and operator performance over time)|

of thermal sensation (TSENS) survey scores obtained in a range of test environments in which dissatisfaction was assumed to occur at TSENS absolute values of 2 or greater. With this method, a PMV of ±0.5 predicts 90% of a population satisfied, or a 10% PPD.

However, in most buildings this 90% satisfied rating is rarely obtained, with maximum satisfaction around 80%. The difference has been ascribed to discomfort perceived in local parts of the body. The probability of local discomfort is predicted by testing environmental parameters measured in sensitive locations against empirically-determined limits. Rates of temperature change are also limited to avoid discomfort. Local discomfort effects are assumed to contribute an additional 10% PPD to the discomfort predicted by PMV, so that the total PPD expected in a building with PMV ±0.5 will be 20%.

b. In the adaptive method, used for naturally ventilated spaces, environmental measurements are linked to satisfaction through an empirical model in which the prevailing mean outdoor temperature determines the position of percent satisfied contours bordering the comfort zone. Section 5.4 defines prevailing mean outdoor air temperature. Local discomfort limits are not used in the adaptive method. Modify Table L3 as shown.

# L3.2.1 Point-in-Time (Short-Term) Analyses

a. PMV Model

1. Measures. PMV heat balance model prediction of thermal sensation and satisfaction from environmental measurements are described in Section 5.3 (including air movement extension in Section 5.3.35.3.2). Limits to local thermal discomfort are described in Section 5.3.45.3.3 and rates of temperature change are described in Section 5.3.55.3.4.
2. Criteria for Passing. –0.5 to +0.5 on the PMV scale, inclusive. This represents an estimated 90% satisfied with the thermal environment. Expressed as a comfort zone on a psychrometric chart, this represents a temperature range of 3K to 5K (5°F to 8°F), depending on clothing level and humidity (Figure 5.2.1.1).

b. Local Thermal Discomfort Limits. Local thermal should, by itself, not exceed the limits prescribed in Section 5.3.45.3.3. At a minimum, an assumed 10% dissatisfaction caused by local discomfort is added to PMV-predicted discomfort to obtain the overall thermal dissatisfaction of an environment.

Solar radiation on occupants in neutral or warm conditions should not exceed 10% of outdoor solar radiation incident on the window. The best-practice upper limit is 5% (ASHRAE 2013).

# Abstract

The courtyard is one of the architectural features used in ancient times for many purposes, such as climate modifiers, as a place for family gatherings, and as a playground for children. Over time, the courtyard feature in residential buildings, starting with the old vernacular Arabian architecture and ending up with the contemporary constructions of today, allows the essential nature of culture to be re-justified and properly analyzed in the context of the current era. Going through the history of courtyards in the vernacular architecture in Saudi Arabia since the 1950s, it was conventionally and commonly integrated because of its beneficial application and significance of natural design basics in Islamic and traditional architecture.

Courtyard housing is known as the oldest form of residence. It had shown for the first time in ancient civilization excavated at Kahun in The Middle East in Egypt, which back to 5000 years old to the City of Ur before 2000 B.C. [1-3]. In the beginning, the courtyard or Patio concept was mainly to provide a saved private family outdoor area from outside forces from humans and wild animals. Over time, the design of the Courtyard developed into a solid, logical configuration that maximizes the built-up area in the urban context and allows privacy, controlled sunlight, more ventilation, and plant growth [4]. Saudi Arabia had very hot weather in summer which needs well-studied ventilation to decrease HVAC loads and provide well-air distribution within the interior spaces.

Today, designers and notaries bear a heavy burden in documenting this rich heritage. Traditions are vulnerable in

The face of the sound waves of modernization and globalization. In response, research on vernacular architecture has focused on studying, documenting, and preserving historical and traditional buildings before they disappear [5].

The kingdom of Saudi Arabia has four provinces with totally different climatic conditions. Hence, the paper will study only the central region "Najd". The other provinces will be studied further in the upcoming series.

The paper explains the central region climate conditions as well as the houses elements and components considering several points, such as the average number of family members, the common average courtyards size, the average ratio of the built-up area, the average number of floors, and the number of openings. All the applied factors should be connected to the nature, surroundings, and cultural aspects as well. This paper aims to examine the effectiveness of courtyards as a sustainable technique taking into consideration various factors including economic, social, and ecological factors.

There will be seven case studies, three cases will show the application of courtyard and a detailed analysis of houses components in the vernacular architecture. The other four cases will represent new houses which are built recently with all related details. After analyzing all case study elements, the discussion will be shown.

# 1.1. Research Objective

The research aims at studying and investigating the design motivations of courtyards, which utilizes the efficiency of the architectural concept itself and the influences on vernacular architecture throughout history. It also analyses the types of Najd courtyards and compares the main categories of Najd houses from different perspectives during different times and discovers more about the effective solutions that the courtyard offers as one of the significant sustainable applications in architecture.

# 1.2. Research Questions

At this point, critical research questions are raised.

# 1.2.1. Is it possible to adapt the concept of the courtyard to modern needs and seek its revival?

# 1.2.2. In terms of sustainability, what are the most likely benefits?

# 2. Materials and Methods

The research used qualitative methodology [9,10], based on the assessment of the architectural characteristics and properties of courtyards. This paper examined the effectiveness of courtyards as a design tool for vernacular buildings by examining buildings that reflect and preserve historical and cultural aspects. To examine all angles that affect the building's components, area, and functionality, the researchers selected various case studies from old and new houses.

# 3. Literature Review

# 3.1. History of the Courtyard

As a climate and privacy modifier, the courtyard serves an important role. Based on the region and the level of wealth of the builders, the importance of the courtyard and the relationship between its area and height differ [11]. It remains a square or rectangular plan despite these variations. Well-heeled townhouses might have gardens in their courtyards. Paved walkways raised above ground level divide these areas, which are usually richly paved with stone or tile as shown in figure 1. The owners construct a fountain or pool around the figure when they have water figures available. Even poor houses may have some trees, a plantation, or a small tank, demonstrating how the landscape was used as a visual feature within courtyards [12,13].# Civil Engineering and Architecture 11(2): 675-695, 2023

example of cultural habits. The courtyards are usually surrounded by paths for circulation and one row of rooms. All the rooms have direct access to the courtyard, except for the male quarters [7,8,14,15]. Throughout the day, the courtyard's extensive surface area stores a large amount of thermal mass to provide warmth during cooler nights. In addition to limiting severe temperature stress, the courtyard reradiates the interior heat into the night air because of its high surface-to-volume ratio. As proven by Muhaisen and Gadi that the heating and cooling requirements of courtyard buildings are significantly influenced by their proportions [16-18].

The exposure of courtyards in contemporary Arab architecture reflects an evolutional modification of the concept of the Arabian traditional house. Before tracing the reasons for this emergence, it is important to spot some light on the traditional courtyard house in the vernacular architecture within the region which is considered as a doant paradigm in the context of sustainability for hot and dry climates [8].

Baruch Givoni emphasized this concept as he indicates that residential buildings with internal courtyards are considered the most appropriate and suitable in many hot regions, especially deserts [8,19]. Although housing typologies are a result of multiple determinants, climate and culture are the two most important determinants [20]. In this sense, Majdi Hariri identified the specific functions of the traditional courtyard in the region [21]:

- A family gathering area that can double as a living room and dining area.
- A place to sleep comfortably and calmly during the summer nights.
- Play area under the observation of the mother where children can safely have fun.
- For the nearby rooms, a source of natural light and ventilation.
- A pleasant microclimate within the building.
- A house-wide circulation hub that allows movement from one space to another.

Saudi Arabia is considered as one of the largest countries in the gulf, therefore, very-well established vernacular traditions will be found in different regions. Most researchers divide Saudi Arabia into four regions that each one has a completely different architectural style, construction techniques, and materials [5]. These regions are:

1. The Western (Hijaz) region, a hot humid coastal plain along the Red Sea.
2. The Central and northern (Najd) region, mainly a vast hot dry plateau in the center of the country or tile as shown in figure 2.
3. The Eastern region, a hot humid region along the Arabian Gulf.
4. The Southern (Asir) region is a high mountainous province to the southwest side.

The courtyard provides a safe playground for children, under the direct supervision of the mother or parents in general and provides a convenient space for living activities for adults in the open air, so it holds family gatherings during the daytime while enjoying coffee as an.# Courtyard Existence between the Past and the Present, Case Study: Central Region, Saudi Arabia

Vernacular architecture in the four regions is stately different. The four vernacular styles were developed and improved over time to create a comfortable living setting in response to many multiple factors such as harsh climate, culture, economy, and availability of local building materials within the same context of the ecosystem [22,23].

# 3.2. Courtyard Types & Existence Importance

Majjdi Hariri classified courtyard types in traditional Saudi houses into three categories including, family courtyard, guests’ courtyard, and animals’ courtyard [21] as shown in figure 4. Courtyards have been generally referred to as a microclimate changer, due to their ability to mitigate high temperatures, channel breezes and adjust the degree of humidity [28].

The main vernacular architectural styles and their basic building techniques in the four regions are summarized by Mahjoub and Hwais. They stated the general features of the vernacular architecture [25,26]. The paper focuses on the Central region (Najd) for houses' case studies to represent the essence of the research, which builds its argument based on the literature review where this region is the most.

Courtyards also were acting as a source of airflow thermal comfort to the residence. With the right position to the house and suitable material, it can also help to reduce the heat gained this will act efficiently with the properties of self-shading and thermal lag. Additionally, courtyard acts like a cool air reservoir, especially in hot-arid climates [2,29,30] as shown in figure 5. Not only is the courtyard used as an air controller, but also it is a method of adapting the strategies of vernacular design as a major trend in the bioclimatic architecture [31-33].

It helps to decrease the ratio of energy consumption and reinforces the general performance of the building and supports its efficiency by allowing the building to embrace more natural light and make use of it.

# 4. Results

# 4.1. Courtyards in the Central Region (Najd)

Many papers in the literature proved that the complete dependence on the active systems ignoring the importance of climbing gradually the three tiers of sustainability as shown in figure 6 [34,35] and applying the fundamental sustainable basics at the first phases of design, “such as the interior planning, site design, landscaping, building orientation, exterior shading, openings, construction materials, and building form”, will create a huge instability in the building performance. This unbalance might cause many health problems for the users like sick building syndrome (SBS), which is a condition when people in a building suffer from symptoms of illness or become infected with chronic disease from the building in which they work or reside [36,37].

# 4.2. Climate Analysis, Central Region (Najd)

For the specific region, there will be many factors that affect the construction techniques, sustainable applications, and finishing materials. Micro-climate is considered one of the most significant factors that plays a major role in the architectural atmosphere. Therefore, the demands of a hot climate led to several design characteristics. A courtyard is a well-recognized one that has been used for many buildings in houses, schools, mosques and government buildings, but for this research, the residential category is the highlighted one.

In the central region, mostly summers are considered long, sweltering, and arid; the winters are cool and dry, and it is mostly clear year-round. Throughout the year, the temperature usually varies from 49°F (9.4°C) to 110°F (43.3°C) and is seldom below 41°F (5°C) or above 114°F (45.6°C).

The hot season stays for 4 months, from May 13 to September 23, with an average daily high temperature above 102°F (38.9°C). The hottest day of the year is July 25. The cool season stays for 3 months, from November 26 to February 26, with an average daily high temperature below 76°F (24.4°C). The coldest day of the year is January 11.

Clusters of houses in the vernacular architecture at Najd were more associated to each other, which affected the psychological manners and cultural habits of residents. This type of configurations reinforced with the use of courtyards support socializing, openness, collaboration, and generosity. The concept of neighborhoods is that they are one spirit, what one house needs the second one will immediately offer [40].

# 4.3. Vernacular Case-study, Central Region (Najd)

the construction techniques in the vernacular architecture of the central region were successfully achieving sustainability regarding the three tiers approach of the sustainable design, taking into consideration the current location and the micro-climate as well. It emphasized the effective basic building design [41], and reinforced the building performance using the passive HVAC systems and minimizing the use of mechanical equipment, electrical machines, and active systems in general, refer to figure 12, [42].# Civil Engineering and Architecture 11(2): 675-695, 2023

For further information to have a better understanding of the following case studies, nature context considered one of the major ecological and human characteristics in the vernacular architecture of “Najd”, the central region. Najd is considered as a desert ecosystem, a large, extremely dry area of land with sparse vegetation. It is one of Earth’s major types of ecosystems, supporting a community of distinctive plants and animals specially adapted to the harsh nature.

# 4.4. Design of Najd Traditional Houses

Figure 13. Saad ibn Saud Palace in Ar Riyad, Saudi Arabia

Traditional houses in central region include identical spaces and features and their form has mainly two floors, two sections for Male & Female, with two separate entrances. The Courtyards consistently existed, but differences were there with relation to the house size, based on the economic aspects. They have small openings in general. An example of an existing case-study for the commoners' type is shown in the below figure 14, named commoners regarding the dominance of this planning system to be the most common type among residents during that era. In the commoners' type example, the depth of rectangular courtyard has a major airflow inside spaces.

# 4.5. Examples of House Types in Najd (Case studies)

There are seven case studies: three types of traditional buildings and four of Contemporary houses in Najd. Thus, after these classifications, the house elements will be presented easily in the following table 1.

# 4.5.1. Commoners Houses Examples

The maximum built-up area is 60 -70 m² and was considered the most common type of house during that era. In Saudi Arabia, earth-based architecture has been used for thousands of years. It is believed that Al Dir’iyah, the first capital of Saudi Arabia, was built with earth a long time ago. Dir'iyah's first recorded settlement dates back to 1446 AD. In the period between 1745 and 1818, Al Dir'iyah developed into a large city containing amazing earthen architecture as shown in figure 13.

# 4.5.2. Middle-class Houses

Middle houses could reach 100 m² and have small openings in general as shown in figure 15. The second example of the traditional housing in the old capital of the first state of Saudi Arabia, Al Dir’iyah represents the Middle-class category. The house usually contains more than one courtyard, entrance, stairs, and several bedrooms.# Civil Engineering and Architecture 11(2): 675-695, 2023

# 5. Discussion

After the observation of different case studies of the vernacular buildings including the three main categories, commoners, middle-class, and the upper class, the dominant sustainable application was the courtyard, and it exists in all three types as a mutual feature. One of the advantages of the courtyard during that time is the availability of this factor for all the social classifications, poor, middle, and wealthy people. The efficient application of courtyards as a sustainable technique served the climate of the region wisely and provided healthy ventilation, and a sufficient amount of energy to raise the level of the building performance of light and HVAC as shown in the below figure 18. It provided a strong fundamental reinforcement during the complete lack of active systems such as mechanical equipment and electrical systems.# Civil Engineering and Architecture 11(2): 675-695, 2023

For the second part of the comparison where the contemporary designs of houses show up, there are four common types, small apartments, big apartments, floor villa with an extension, and two floors villa. Many changes can be noticed, but the first common feature in this part is the absence of courtyards in all four houses.

Also, there are new elements that showed up, such as terraces, exterior yards, and even dirty kitchens which could be one of the new items as well. In addition, some new modifications for the plan configuration like the multipurpose rooms, exterior storage in the yard, and exterior reception room “Diywaniya”. Additionally, animal rooms were eliminated of the new approach of residents in owning or constructing farms in different areas, could be inside or outside the city [11].

After the absence of courtyards, the new elements that showed up instead, of them might be good alternatives at first sight, and some are not. The concept of a courtyard was reconfigured to be an external space that is distributed all around the built area of a house, which is later called a yard. This new feature led people to build higher fencing systems to create a private enclosure for users and to have a ventilation flow around the house openings.

Active systems were integrated into buildings as well, and it became more dependent on the use of electrical systems and mechanical ventilation, unlike the vernacular era which used to be mainly dependent on natural-passive systems.

# Recommendations

This research called for a return to sustainable design, which depends on architectural treatments from the design stage and adherence to important elements such as the presence of courtyard, which supports not only the conservational aspect but the economic and social aspect and searches for interconnection between family and society members as a whole.

# 6. Conclusions

After the general analysis of the case studies both the vernacular and the contemporary, it would be simple to understand the consequences behind the abandonment of courtyards in the current house designs. The amount of dependence on the electrical systems and mechanical equipment raises both the construction and the operation cost currently, while buildings of the vernacular architecture have lesser costs at both levels.# Courtyard Existence between the Past and the Present, Case Study: Central Region, Saudi Arabia

Clusters of houses in the vernacular architecture at Najd were more associated to each other, which affected the psychological manners and cultural habits of residents. This type of configurations reinforced with the use of courtyards support socializing, openness, collaboration, and generosity. The concept of neighborhoods is that they are one spirit, what one house needs the second one will immediately offer [40].
